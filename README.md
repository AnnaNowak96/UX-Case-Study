Case Study for redesign website for Stado OgierÃ³w KsiÄ…Å¼  
Stado KsiÄ…Å¼ is a website presenting all the possibilities and attractions offered by the KsiÄ…Å¼ herd of Silesian stallions. The website provides information related to breeding, organizing horse auctions, equestrian events and exhibitions. Information for tourists, people interested in learning about the history and culture of the place, for people who would like to organize a special event and for those looking for active recreation in the saddle. You can also find here information about the sports side of the herd, i.e. the sports club, driving lessons, and all competitions organized by the herd.  
The final UI design is a clean and intuitive layout, ensuring users can easily navigate through the website without feeling overwhelmed.
By maintaining a consistent visual language throughout the interface, I was able to create a cohesive and harmonious user experience across all pages.
I optimized the layout of the final UI to prioritize important content and features, allowing users to find what they need quickly and efficiently.
By integrating user feedback into the final UI design, I addressed user needs and preferences, ensuring that the interface truly caters to the needs of our audience.
Throughout the design process, I continuously iterated on the UI based on assumptions of designing readable websites, resulting in a final product that prioritizes user satisfaction and usability.
